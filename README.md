## "Bring a life back to power. Make blood donation your responsibility."
Availability of blood for medical emergencies is a major issue in our society. These days we get denied blood till we get donors. Medical emergencies have become heavily dependent on replacement blood donations which are not only unsafe but also a potential way of exploiting patients and their families.
##
Our project is an innovative approach to address global health. We provide immediate access to blood donors all over India, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! We provide a network of donors who respond to emergency situations efficiently. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-access, efficient and reliable way to get life-saving blood, free of cost. Our project works to connect blood donors and recipients through a system accessible on any device. We provide blood donors who are ready to help save lives any time and at any place to people who are desperately in need of it.
