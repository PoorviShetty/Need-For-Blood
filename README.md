# Need for Blood
## "Bring a life back to power. Make blood donation your responsibility."
Availability of blood for medical emergencies is a major issue in our society. These days we get denied to blood until we get donors. Medical emergencies have become heavily dependent on replacement blood donations which are not only unsafe but also a way of exploiting patients and their families.
##
Our project is an innovative approach to address global health. We provide immediate access to blood donors all over India, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! We provide a network of donors who respond to emergency situations in an efficient manner. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-access, efficient and reliable way to get life-saving blood, free of cost. Our project works to connect blood donors and recipients through a system which can be accessed on any device. We provide blood donors who are ready to help save lives any time and at any place to people who are desperately in need of it.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
